#### **From Circuits to Code: ⚡️ My Data Science Journey**

As an electronics engineer, I've always been fascinated by how things work –
from the intricate dance of electrons to the complex systems that power our
world. However, I also felt a pull towards understanding human behavior and
finding ways to improve our lives.This led me to explore the world of data
science, where I discovered a powerful tool for connecting technology and human
experience.

I'm currently pursuing a Data Science certificate at MIT Emerging Talent, eager
to expand my knowledge and build a strong foundation in this exciting field.
While I'm still learning to navigate the world of networking and public speaking
(let's just say I have a healthy dose of stage fright!), I'm excited to share my
journey and connect with others in this community.

**My Skills** 🛠️

* **Programming:** Basic Python, Matlab, C++ (Basics)
* **Tools:** Familiar with Git, GitHub and VS Code
* **Power Electronics:** Experience in designing and analyzing power electronic
  circuits (e.g., converters, inverters, rectifiers).
* **CAD:** AutoCAD for electrical drawings
* **Circuit Simulation:** LTspice for circuit design and simulation
* **Learning:** SQL (expanding my horizons!)

**What I'm Building** 💡

This space is a testament to my journey of learning and exploration. Here,
you'll find projects that reflect my growing interest in:

* **Data-driven solutions for electronics:** Exploring the intersection of
  machine learning and embedded systems.
* **Human-centered applications:** Developing projects that address real-world
  challenges and improve people's lives.

**My Goals** 🚀

* **Short-term:** Build a strong portfolio of data science projects to showcase
  my skills and land a role where I can learn and grow.
* **Long-term:** Contribute to innovative solutions that leverage the power of
  data to create a positive impact on the world.

**Beyond the Tech World** ☕️

Outside of coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, indulging in good
motivational speeches, or spending quality time with family. I'm also deeply
curious about the universe, life, and everything in between.
